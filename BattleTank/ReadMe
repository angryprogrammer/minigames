Design a program to simulate battle tanks.It should meet following requirements: (
    1) There would be two types of battle tanks– Mini and Jumbo.
(2) Each battle tank should be able to move forward by 1 unit in the current direction when a“ Move”,

    .
(5) A battle tank would be given some X unit of fuel.
(6) Battle tank can fire gun according to the power level given in the command.

For Mini battle tank: (1) There would be 4 power levels.
(2) Each fire reduces the(1 * power level) unit of fuel.For example fuel consumed
for power level four is 4.(I.e.1 * 4).
(3) Each move or turn of battle tank reduces the fuel by 1 unit.

For Jumbo battle tank: (1) There would be 5 power levels.
(2) Each fire reduces the(2 * power level) units of fuel.
(3) Each move or turn of battle tank reduces the fuel by 2 units.
