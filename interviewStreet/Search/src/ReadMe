You will find solution to one of the InterviewStreet code problems called LogFind
as described in the problemDefinition file.  here. Since the final solution will be
run against a huge file I have written a script to generate which generates a really
big file , Dont even think about opening it in VIM :P.

You can generate your own "data" file by making the makedata.sh script executable.

Warning: makedata.sh script will make file as big as 5GB but you can customize as
per your needs.

$ chmod 755 makedata.sh
$ ./makeData.sh


The solution is in logFind.java with a sample output of big file in bigFileSampleOuput.
